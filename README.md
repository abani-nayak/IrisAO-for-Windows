# IrisAO-for-Windows

This is the windows version of the deformable mirror from IrisAO. The source code can already be found from the publisher which is written in C/C++. Here, I will use python to develop the control interface of the deformable mirror using cython. 

I have Windows 10 and x64 bit OS. I am using anaconda3 for executing all my python3 programs.
